        Hello, I am Bryson! Have you ever thought of what you would do after
        high school before you graduated? Did you have a plan? And did it go to
        plan? I know I did. I planned on going to community college and studying
        hardware engineering and then transferring to a four-year university. It
        did not go to plan. I ended up going to community college and changing
        my degree 3 times! This website is here to help push you in the right
        direction and help you find your passion. Whether that passion is in
        Computer Science, Hardware Engineering, or Web Development. You can
        learn more about me on my <a href="about_me.html">about me</a> page.
