        My journey begins my senior year of high school, 2019-2020. I started
        off my senior year well. I was taking AP Calculus and taking local
        community college classes in the AE transfer program with NC State. I
        had good grades, on track to graduate college in fall 2021 and
        scholarship with the AROTC @ State. I was also sent to The Citadel by
        the Navy for leadership and future citizen training. Then disaster
        struck in the form of SARS-CoV-2. We went online and my grades and
        everything school related went down. I ended up graduating over Zoom
        with a measly ~3.2 gpa. It was measly in a way that I thought I could no
        longer receive scholarships and support for school. My first job at the
        time was family business with my father. It's a log cabin company and I
        learned alot from him. I spent summer 2020 traveling and working until I
        started college in the fall. I started out in the Associates in
        Engineering transfer program with the intention of transferring to State
        and getting a Computer Engineering Degree. At the time, I was not
        interested in software development, in fact, I hated it. I couldn’t
        understand it. I thought it was too hard and I found myself
        understanding hardware components much easier than I did with software.
        My first year in college was all online while I worked full time with my
        father and it went poorly. I ended up dropping 3 out of the 9 classes I
        took (5 fall semester and 4 spring). I then failed one class and the
        others were C’s with one B letter grade. It was after my fall semester,
        that I wanted to switch to Wake Tech and study their Electrical
        Engineering and transfer over to State with my same intentions in
        hardware. Once I made my switch and started at Wake in the fall of 2021,
        it was a night and day difference. My mental was much better than it was
        during the year 2020 and I started to enjoy going to school, even though
        I drove an hour 3 days a week just to get there. Once my winter break
        was over for 2021, I started to look for jobs that could help with my
        degree. I eventually got an interview with a phone/computer repair shop.
        The store was just opening and it was a franchise repair shop. I got the
        job and the store opened up in April 2022. It was at this time that I
        learned more about hardware components and expanded my soldering skills.
        The company I worked for was uBreakiFix.

      <h2>My Experience at UBreakiFIx</h2>
      <p id="exp-content">
        Starting out in the trenches as a lowly repair technician, I was hired
        on with three other techs with the same amount of phone repair and
        customer service experience, which was none. After working there for
        about 6 months, I was promoted to Lead Tech and the owners of the store
        paid for some of my training in soldering and leadership courses. All
        went well and the team that I was hired on with, only one guy was left.
        The others had left or been fired. We went through two managers and 5
        different team members. Eventually the owners wanted to promote me and
        about 3 months ago, I made it to the Store Manager position after
        starting out as a tech.
